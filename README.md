Attaching Appendix here as we didn't want to clutter the original report with this:

**Statement of Work:**

Rootvij B. handled the Linear Regression piece of the model.
Arnav M. handled the Random Forest piece of the model.
Harit A. handled the SVM piece of the model.
The three of us collaborated on pre-processing, research, model improvement, and writing out the report.
