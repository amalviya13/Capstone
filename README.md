# Capstone

This repository contains five Jupyter notebooks for combining data from Kaggle and the API-Ninjas Celebrity API, performing exploratory analysis, and building various machine learning models to predict net worth. The notebooks are named:

1. Building Net Worth CSV.ipynb: This notebook combines financial data from Kaggle and Ninja's financial app that we export then to modify and create the master final_dataset CSV file for analysis.
2. Exploratory Analysis.ipynb: This notebook contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the net worth data. It includes visualizations and statistics to understand the distribution and relationship between variables.
3. Linear_regression.ipynb: This notebook contains a linear regression model for predicting net worth based on a set of features.
4. Random Forest Model.ipynb: This notebook contains a random forest regression model for predicting net worth based on a set of features.
5. svr.ipynb: This notebook contains a support vector regression model for predicting net worth based on a set of features.

To run the notebooks, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries mentioned in the 'requirements.txt' file by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt in your command 3. prompt/terminal.
3. Open Jupyter Notebook on your local machine by running the command jupyter notebook in your command prompt/terminal.
4. Navigate to the location where you have cloned the repository.
5. Open each notebook (.ipynb file) in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequential order.
6. The outputs will be generated in the notebook itself.
7. Start with running the Building Net Worth CSV.ipynb

**Statement of Work:**

Rootvij B. handled the Linear Regression piece of the model.
Arnav M. handled the Random Forest piece of the model.
Harit A. handled the SVM piece of the model.
The three of us collaborated on pre-processing, research, model improvement, and writing out the report.
